#### About Me

Namaste!

This is where I dump part of what’s on my mind. It ranges from simple tutorials, my experiences or just ideas. With this, I am hoping I stay in touch with writing as well as help aspiring software developers achieve their goals.

My name is Nachiket (nuh-chee-kate). I am a Computer Science Master’s student at Khoury College of Computer Sciences (previously College of Computer and Information Science) Northeastern University, Boston. I'll be graduating in December 2020.

I like solving puzzles, problems, and challenges (although most of the problems are like puzzles for me) and I am addicted to the high of learning something new (as cliche as that sounds).

PS: I'm working on migrating articles from my wordpress blog - [https://nachiketsd.wordpress.com/blog/](https://nachiketsd.wordpress.com/blog/).
